## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid and media queries
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I refreshed my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. I brushed up on concepts like flexbox, grid for creating flexible layouts, simplifying the alignment and distribution of elements within the container. I utilized media queries to craft responsive and user-friendly designs for the project. Additionally, I learned about some new CSS properties that I had heard of before but didn't know how to apply in real-world projects.

### Continued development
I struggled a bit to center the container element but I manage to solve this problem on my own
